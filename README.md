This is a managing app that helps users to monitor their task routine. The most interesting part is the Dashboard Page: it helps users to visualise their action behaviour and patterns to realize how to achieve their goals in future.

Users  just need to fill out and submit the ToDos, Routine or Spendings form. Users  can modify them anytime! Create as many as needed and set up deadline periods. Choose Long-, Medium-, Short- or other run periods when users would like to complete them!
AI will analyse their history of stock prices and provide useful recommendations (Bonus Part).
